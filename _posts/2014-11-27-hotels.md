Below is a map of hotels that are withing a reasonable distance from the 
wedding venue. A cab ride from city center to the venue will be inexpensive. 
Also we will have shuttle buses from a central Palma location to the venue for 
the ceremony. The map also has the house that the wedding party will be staying 
in and the ceremony venue.
