Below is a map of hotels that are withing a reasonable distance from the 
wedding venue. Also on the map is the venue (Red Star) and the house the
wedding party is staying in (Green Diamond).
We'll have shuttle busses from Palma to the venue for the ceromony but a 
cab ride from there will also be inexpensive.
