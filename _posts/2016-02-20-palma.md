## Bars and Restaurants

- [Nassau Beach Club](http://www.nassaubeachclub.com/inicio/)

> This place is a bit ‘posh’ however their Thaisalad, sushi and tuna tartar is amazing. And so are 
> their drinks. You can also reserve a spot at the beach and they serve you drinks and food there. 
> It’s perfect for a day at the beach or dinner afterwards. (Definitely make a reservation)

- [Almare](http://www.almare.es/en/about-us/)

> If you are craving some Italian food (I know you are in Spain but close enough), this is the place 
> to go. The mussels and the linguine Frutti di Mare are fantastic.

- [Hotel Cap Rocat](http://www.caprocat.com)

> This place is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever seen. It is simply amazing and it has 
> two fantastic restaurants: El Restaurante de la Fortaleza and the Sea Club. If you want to treat 
> yourself (and why wouldn’t you, you are on vacation) this is the place to go. Single ladies (and 
> interested gentlemen): Their waiters are beautiful and just because of that it is worth stopping by

- [Ola del Mar]( http://www.oladelmar.es/it/p/17/el_restaurante.html)

> If you are a lover of seafood, this is a great place for you to go. They also have different versions
