Son Mir is a “Finca” (Estate) which dates back to the XVII century and is 
mentioned in the book written by the Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria, 
“Die Balearum” in which it is listed as being the 10th most important 
agricultural and livestock farm in Majorca. In other words, we are surrounded 
by land which has great historical tradition within the framework of the 
Majorcan estates.
