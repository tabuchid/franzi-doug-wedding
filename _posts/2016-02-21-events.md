Hey everyone, we are super excited for all of you to celebrate with us. 
For everyone who will be there a few days prior to the actual wedding here is what we have in mind. 
None of these are official wedding events, and most people from Europe won't fly in till friday, and a lot from the US plan a Europe trip 
(which we think you should) but in case some of you are on the island already here are some thoughts on events!
 
All of the suggested events depend on how many people will be there already so they are subject to change:
 
- Tuesday, June 21st: Take the train to Soller with us and visit the beautiful little town up in the mountains.
- Wednesday, June 23nd: Sail with us around the island, enjoy a day of water, bbq and music on a boat.
- Thursday, June 24rd: Welcome dinner for out-of-towners.. around 6pm: We are not sure where yet but we will figure it out.
- Friday, June 25th: Wedding day
- Saturday, June 25th: Brunch... time and place TBD: but rather later in the day :)
